## HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Human Resource (HR) departments often face challenges in understanding workforce trends, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), and making data-driven decisions to improve employee engagement, retention, and productivity. However, the absence of an interactive and centralized reporting tool can hinder timely insights.

This project aims to solve this problem by developing an HR Analytics Dashboard that visualizes key HR metrics such as attrition rate, average tenure,  and more. The goal is to empower HR professionals and leadership teams with actionable insights through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX
